## Arithmetic Progression:
## You are given first three entries of an arithmetic progression. You have to calculate the common difference and print it.


# Write your code here
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
print(c-b)


## Find Average Marks:
## Write a program to input marks of three tests of a student (all integers). Then calculate and print the average of all test marks.



# Read input as sepcified in the question
# Print output as specified in the question
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
s=a+b+c
print(s/3)

## Find X raised to power N:

##You are given two integers: X and N. You have to calculate X raised to power N and print it.


# Write your code here
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
print(a**b)

## Find_Average_Marks:
#Find average Marks

#Write a program to input marks of three tests of a student (all integers). Then calculate and print the average of all test marks.

# Read input as sepcified in the question
# Print output as specified in the question

test1=int(input())
test2=int(input())
test3=int(input())
average=(test1+test2+test3)/3
print(average)

## Rectangular Area:

#You are given a rectangle in a plane. The corner coordinates of this rectangle is provided to you. You have to print the amount of area of the plane covered by this rectangles.
##The end coordinates are provided as four integral values: x1, y1, x2, y2. It is given that x1 < x2 and y1 < y2.



# Write your code here

x1=int(input())
y1=int(input())
x2=int(input())
y2=int(input())
print((x2-x1)*(y2-y1))
